# Models Views and Delegates

Welcome to this course on Models, Views and Delegates.

## Getting Started

Starting from an initially prepared starting point working project `00-Initial Project`, the course will go through a number of sections which you will be able to follow along.

At the end of each section you'll be encouraged to experiment with what you've learned and try out some ideas for yourself.

The git repository for this course contains named folders for each section with a completed Main.qml file for reference (not the entire project).

If you are ever unsure of what you've done, need to reset or just want to review a section, you can copy any of the reference Main.qml files into your project at any time.

## Instructions

To get started with this project, you will need to have Qt and an IDE (e.g Qt Creator) installed on your computer. You can download Qt and Qt Creator from the [Qt.io website](qt.io).

Once you have Qt and an IDE installed, head over to [Qt Academy](academy.qt.io) and follow along to create the project template and add the assets to the project.

To run the project in Qt Creator, navigate to the folder `00-Initial Project` open the `CMakeLists.txt` file. Build and run the project in Qt Creator. The application will launch and you will see the application at that current stage.


## Resouces

Attributions for any assets used can be found in the `assets/attributtion.txt` file in the `00-Initial Project` folder.
